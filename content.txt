Yo Id heard all the cool kids talking about Elm the functional frontend language and how it solves problems of JavaScript at scale particularly the issue of runtime exceptions Proponents claim that Elm eliminates nullpointer exceptions if
 your code compiles it will never throw an exception at runtime

I had to find out more so I flew to Norway to attend a oneday workshop in Elm programming run by the organisers of the Oslo Elm Day At their most recent event they had  developers and a prog metal band
 
Heres how Elm eliminates runtime exceptions data is wrapped in a Maybe Monad with a Just and Nothing interface Every time you want to deal with the value of a variable you write two code paths one for Just it has a value and one for Nothing it has
 no value

In JavaScript you do this with

if req  reqbody  reqbodydata  reqbodydataname { 
     do something with reqbodydataname  
}
 
This is a programming convention however and its not enforced by the compiler  so it can easily be left out Failure to test for the existence of a data field killed the Azure table storage library during Magikcrafts first World Record attempt I submitted
 a patch that got merged in to the Azure JavaScript SDK 
 
In Elm you have to account for the possibility of null or your code wont compile 
 
Apples Swift language has optional chaining to deal with this but JavaScript doesnt

You can achieve something close to this level of code correctness without switching to Elm by using TypeScript and the TSmonad library It makes your code more verbose and forces you to deal with possible exceptions in code pathways and guarantees that
 your code will never throw a runtime exception
