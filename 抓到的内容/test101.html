      Yo, I'd heard all the cool kids talking about Elm -the functional front-end language- and how it solves problems of JavaScript at scale; particularly the issue of run-time exceptions. Proponents claim that Elm eliminates null-pointer exceptions: if
 your code compiles it will *never* throw an exception at run-time.

I had to find out more, so I flew to Norway to attend a one-day workshop in Elm programming run by the organisers of the Oslo Elm Day. At their most recent event they had 120 developers and a prog metal band.
 
Here's how Elm eliminates run-time exceptions: data is wrapped in a "Maybe" Monad with a Just and Nothing interface. Every time you want to deal with the value of a "variable" you write two code paths: one for Just (it has a value) and one for Nothing (it has
 no value).

In JavaScript you do this with:

if (req && req.body && req.body.data && req.body.data.name) { 
    // do something with req.body.data.name...  
}
 
This is a programming convention, however, and it's not enforced by the compiler - so it can easily be left out. Failure to test for the existence of a data field killed the Azure table storage library during Magikcraft's first World Record attempt (I submitted
 a patch that got merged in to the Azure JavaScript SDK). 
 
In Elm you *have* to account for the possibility of null, or your code won't compile. 
 
Apple's Swift language has "optional chaining" to deal with this, but JavaScript doesn't.

You can achieve something close to this level of code correctness -without switching to Elm- by using TypeScript and the TS-monad library. It makes your code more verbose, and forces you to deal with possible exceptions in code pathways... and guarantees that
 your code will never throw a run-time exception.

          Whilst we appreciate your enthusiasm, we'll be accepting no unsolicited phone calls to discuss this position prior to reviewing your applications.Senior Front End Engineer
        
        We are currently seeking all the buzz words. 


Angular, React, Node, ES6, Typescript 


If you recognise any of these words then your probably not looking for opportunities, because every person in Brisbane that's job title finishes in 'er' has already approached you for the 500 other possibilities available.

So rather than throwing a shopping list at you in the hope we can day trade on some keywords, we want to have a conversation about this company on the off chance you are looking.


Why would you want to work for this company? Well, I will cut to the chase and give you some reasons.


They Ship Stuff - They are a startup that has a market validated. The product that is monetized and used globally.
Funding. They have it. Don't expect the 'we are interviewing people while we wait for their next round of cash'. The investment is in the bank; the product validated and their product roadmap is clear. If you are good, they will hire you
 quickly and will have plenty of work for you to do.  Leadership - You will be working with a Dev Manager who has done the hard yards, used to work for some huge companies, has the battle scars, picked up the soft skills and has earned his right to step away from the tools.
Technical Leadership - But that doesn't mean they have. This manager actively gets involved in rolling up sleeves, learning new tech and supporting the team in the clutch (you can currently find them elbow deep in Ansible at the moment).
Culture - This is a brogrammer free zone. Your working in a startup environment but with adults given the freedom to focus on being who they want to contribute in different ways and live their best lives. Want to go for a beer with the
 team... great, want to head home and see the kids..good idea. Want to stay back and code, go for it. 
They invest in Technology - They have built a successful platform that works well but are not sitting there waiting for it to become a legacy platform. They are using a React in the Front End using SASS and LESS as well using a mix of Java
 & Scala in the backend. They don't need experts in this but want people who are capable of transferring their practical experience and skills and who can stay on the front foot and always keep on the front foot. 
Rewards - They pay on and above market for the right people. Their rewards and benefits extend beyond just salary and focus on a range of things to make your life their both enjoyable and meaningful. 

If you're an experienced Front End Engineer who is keen to stretch and want to do it somewhere, that is going places, and you have ample demonstratable commercial experience in modern JavaScript frameworks and more importantly a passion for it then this
 could be the role for you.

If this sounds of interest get in touch. Know anyone who is suitable? We offer $1000 for a successful referral. 

Interested? Call Aaron on 0408 966 944 to discuss.
